# Simple Python Calculator

A basic calculator script built with **Python** and **Tkinter** to perform simple arithmetic.

## ✨ Features
* **Core operations:** Supports Addition (+) and Subtraction (-).
* **Clear Function:** Ability to clear the screen for new calculations.
* **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use buttons and display.

## 🎓 What I Learned
Through this project, I focused on understanding how code interacts with a user interface:
* **Logic Flow:** How to capture numbers and store them for calculation.
* **Global Variables:** Used to keep track of the first number during operations.
* **Lambda Functions:** Used to send specific values from the buttons to the code logic.
* **Grid System:** Organizing buttons in rows and columns.

## 🚀 How to run
1. Open the `calculator.py` file in any Python environment.
2. Run the script and start calculating!
